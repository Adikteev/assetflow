# assetflow

Assetflow is an asset deployment pipeline for node. It enables you to create powerfull asset pipeline flows while it takes care of versioning and cache-busting transparently.

Assetflow is a [Grunt task][grunt] and works with **S3** out of the box. If you are not familiar with Grunt check out the [Grunt's Getting Started guide][Getting Started].

## Overview

A typical flow to deploy with assetflow would be this:

1. Scan assets and generate MD5 hashes.
2. Create the `manifest.json` file.
3. Copy all assets and rename them with their md5 hash to a temporary location.
4. Perform `HEAD` operations with **S3** and compare the asset's md5 hash with the on on S3 ( `ETAG` ).
5. Upload all assets that did not have a matching `ETAG`.

Optionally there are two more tasks you can perform:

* Search & replace on any set of assets based on a custom keyword, i.e. `__ASSET(img/logo.jpg)`.
* Create the `clientManifest.js` file, an optimized for the client subset of the manifest.

## Quick Start

```shell
npm install assetflow --save-dev
```

Open your [Gruntfile][] and add the following config:

```js
  assets: {
      options: {
        manifest: 'temp/manifest.json',
      },
      all: {
        src: ['assets/**'],
        dest: 'temp/assets'
      },
    },
    assetsS3: {
      options: {
        checkS3Head: true,
        manifest: 'temp/manifest.json',
        key: config.aws_key,
        secret: config.aws_secret,
        bucket: config.aws_static_bucket,
        access: 'public-read',
      },
      target: {
        upload: {
          src: 'temp/testCase/**',
          dest:  'folder/',
          gzip: true,
          gzipExclude: ['.jpeg', '.jpg', '.png', '.gif', '.less', '.mp3',
              '.mp4', '.mkv', '.webm', '.gz'],
          headers: {'Cache-Control': 'max-age=31536000, public'}
        }
      }
    }
```

## Grunt Tasks

### assets

The assets task performs these operations:
* Scans all the defined assets.
* Generates **md5** hashes for each asset.
* Create the `manifest.json` file.
  - If a manifest file exists, it will compare md5 against it.
* Copy all new or updated assets and rename them with their md5 hash to a temporary location.

When this task finishes all your assets have been copied to a new temporary folder that you defined. This folder will contain your assets renamed with their md5 like so:

`app.js` --> `app-h522md41d.js`

The `manifest.json` file generated by this task keeps a reference to all your assets so their names can be properly resolved in all environments.

#### `assets` Options

##### manifest
Type: `string` Default: `manifest.json`

Define the location of the manifest file.

##### cdnurl
Type: `string` Default: *none*

Add the url of your CDN to prepend it to all assets.



The assets task will scan all the defined assets, generate md5 hashes, create the `manifest.json` file and copy all the assets to a temporary location renamed with their md5 hash.
